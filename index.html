            <h2>A Holistic Approach to Health and Fitness</h2>
            <p>
                Living well encompasses many aspects of health. Sucess in health and wellness comes from understanding and supporting each area equally. 
                By building wellness plans centered around fitness, nutrition, and mindfulness, people can have the essential building blocks they need to achieve positive change in their lives.

                            Everyone may benefit from coaching, but not everyone will benefit from the same approach. My exercise routines are built with the client 
                            in mind first. By understanding the needs of each person individually, exercise can be designed to help them build strength, improve balance, 
                            and increase endurance based on their unique body type, limitations, and contraindications to exercise. I prioritize safety and ensure 
                            all clients are performing movements with proper form and within their physical capacity. In addition to safety and understanding, I strive
                            to infuse humor and enthusiasm into coaching to make it fun and engaging for each person. With the right energy, they can find joy in 
                            exercise and make it a priority in their lives.

                    <h3>Nutrition</h3>

                        <p>
                            Healthy eating should never be endless dieting with short-term results. It is a lifestyle adjustment that is different depending on 
                            each person's preferences, accesibility to food, and culture. In order to create long-lasting change, my nutrition plans are built 
                            on the foundation of each peron's unique needs and potential struggles. Diving deeper into disordered eating habits tells a bigger story 
                            about a person, which is why it is critical to think bigger than counting calories and weighing macros. Food is more than fuel; it is
                            social and emotional, which is why I approach nutrition coaching with compassion, micro-adjustment techniques, and big picture thinking. 
                            By taking the pressure and complication out of the process, I can help clients learn easy and effective ways to manage their diet.

                    <h3>Mindfulness</h3>

                        <p> 
                            A positive state of mind is essential in making lifestyle adjustments and maintaining the energy to exercise, socialize, cook, and 
                            enjoy life. Mindfulness encompasses areas such as self-compassion, stress management, and coping skills. Living a truly healthy life 
                            means finding balance and taking time to care for the mind as much as the body. Motivation and encouragement are 
                            essential tools I utilize to help my clients stay on track, so even if they encounter plateaus, hurdles, or just the occasional bad day, 
                            they will still have the confidence and drive to keep moving forward.
