            <h2>A Health-Centered Life</h2>
            <p>
               From a young age, I knew that I wanted to be able to make a difference in people's lives. As I discovered different aspects of fitness and 
               wellness in my own life, I learned that exercise could be used to support better physical, emotional, and social health. Through years of exploring
               a variety of practices and techniques, I developed a passion for learning about health and realized that this was how I wanted to help people. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I believe in using a holistic approach to health and wellness because it encompasses a variety of essential aspects to healthy living beyond 
               superifical goals. I approach health by design, and use my compassionate nature, academic knowledge, and personal experience to build wellness 
               plans that are centered around each indivdiual's needs. By making these services accessible, we can improve health in every community and build 
               a foundation for better living. 
            </p>
            <p>
               When we all have the tools to care for ourselves, we can improve our world through better sustainability, lower 
               rates of disease and mental conditions, and an increase in longevity. As a fitness and nutrition coach, I want to be a part of the positive change 
               and growth needed to support wellness from an individual level to a global scale. 
            </p>
